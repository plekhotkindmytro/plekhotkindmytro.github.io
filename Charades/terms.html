  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

  <div>
    <p>You can subscribe for a premium account with unlimited access to all game's modes, decks, content(including new content from future updates).</p>

	<p>Subscription is from $2.99 USD(depends on country) weekly, monthly or yearly.</p>
  
  <h2>Billing Cycles</h2>
  <p>When a user subscribes to any of the subscription plans he is charged instantly and can have access to all the premium and free content for a specific period of time. After that period of time ends, the subscription is renewed automatically.</p>

  <p>For example, if a user subscribes to "Monthly" subscription plan, the user is charged at the moment of subscription, and can access all the premium and free content. The subscription period(one month for montly subscription) lasts from the date of subscribtion and runs for one full period(month for montly subscribtion) from that date. When the full period is ended(one full month for montly subscribtion) the subscription is automatically renewed. If a user cancels a subscription during a subscribtion period the user still can use all the benefits of the subscription plan until the end of full period(one full month for montly subscribtion) of that subscription. So if a user does not want to be subscribed for the next period the user has to cancel the subscribtion during the current subscription period.</p>

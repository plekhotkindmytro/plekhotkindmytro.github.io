  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

  <div>
    <p>You can buy consumable products, if applicable, but they disappear if you remove the app.</p>
    <p>You can subscribe, if applicable,
      to get unlimited access to premium content, all game's modes, decks and a new content from future updates for a period of time. Subscription is required only to be able to access a premium content.</p>
      
    <p>The app can be downloaded for free and contains a basic content that can be accessed and used without a subscription.</p>

	<p>Subscription is from $0.99 USD(depends on a country and a plan) per a specified period of time.</p>
  
  <h2>Billing Cycles</h2>
  <p>When a user subscribes to any of the subscription plans he is charged instantly and can have access to all the premium and free content for a specific period of time. After that period of time ends, the subscription is renewed automatically unless thee user unsubscribes.</p>

  <p>For example, if a user subscribes to "Monthly" subscription plan, the user is charged at the moment of subscription, and can access all the premium and free content. The subscription period(one month for montly subscription) lasts from the date of subscribtion and runs for one full period(month for montly subscribtion) from that date. When the full period is ended(one full month for montly subscribtion) the subscription is automatically renewed. If a user cancels a subscription during a subscribtion period the user still can use all the benefits of the subscription plan until the end of full period(one full month for montly subscribtion) of that subscription. So if a user does not want to be subscribed for the next period the user has to cancel the subscribtion during the current subscription period.</p>

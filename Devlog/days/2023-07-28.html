	<p>
		<b>Project theme: 3..2..1..</b><br><hr>
		My idea: 3..2..1.. means that the game mechanic must be based on time competition. If I create a single player game, than the competition can be against AI or timer.
		So I decided to create a reaction game where a user on shapes that appears on the screen.
		
		Gameplay plan:
		1. User runs the game and see:
			a: Press "SPACE" it the figure displayed is the same as a text display, or "Tab" if the figure differs from the text.
			b: for a correct reaction you get +10 points, for incorrect reaction you get -5 and correct reaction counter is set to zero.
			c: for three correct reactions in a row you get +50 bonus points.
			d: for five correct reaction in a row you get +100.
		
		2. Scripts needed:
			ClickManager - handling user clicks
			GameController - handling score and timer and comparing shape with text, handling floating text animation
			ShapeSpawner - handling shape spawn
			Leaderboard - handling leaderboard
			Shape - to append particle effects
			
			
		3. Canvas objects:
			1. Tutorial text.
			2. Score.
			3. Best score.
			4. time
		4.
